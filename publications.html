				<h3>A Hierarchical Assessment of Adversarial Severity (ICCVW 2021)</h3>

				<hr>

				<div style="overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y: auto; height: 73%;">
					<p>
						<strong>Abstract:</strong> Adversarial Robustness is a growing field that evidences the brittleness of neural networks. Although the literature on adversarial robustness is vast, a dimension is missing in these studies: assessing how severe the mistakes are. We call this notion "Adversarial Severity" since it quantifies the downstream impact of adversarial corruptions by computing the semantic error between the misclassification and the proper label. We propose to study the effects of adversarial noise by measuring the Robustness and Severity into a large-scale dataset: iNaturalist-H. Our contributions are: (i) we introduce novel Hierarchical Attacks that harness the rich structured space of labels to create adversarial examples. (ii) These attacks allow us to benchmark the Adversarial Robustness and Severity of classification models. (iii) We enhance the traditional adversarial training with a simple yet effective Hierarchical Curriculum Training to learn these nodes gradually within the hierarchical tree. We perform extensive experiments showing that hierarchical defenses allow deep models to boost the adversarial Robustness by 1.85% and reduce the severity of all attacks by 0.17, on average.

				<h3>Enhancing Adversarial Robustness via Test-time Transformation Ensembling (ICCVW 2021)</h3>

				<hr>

				<div style="overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y: auto; height: 73%;">
					<p>
						<strong>Abstract:</strong> Deep learning models are prone to being fooled by imperceptible perturbations known as adversarial attacks. In this work, we study how equipping models with Test-time Transformation Ensembling (TTE) can work as a reliable defense against such attacks. While transforming the input data, both at train and test times, is known to enhance model performance, its effects on adversarial robustness have not been studied. Here, we present a comprehensive empirical study of the impact of TTE, in the form of widely-used image transforms, on adversarial robustness. We show that TTE consistently improves model robustness against a variety of powerful attacks without any need for re-training, and that this improvement comes at virtually no trade-off with accuracy on clean samples. Finally, we show that the benefits of TTE transfer even to the certified robustness domain, in which TTE provides sizable and consistent improvements.

				<h3>MAIN: Multi-Attention Instance Network (CVIU 2021)</h3>

				<hr>

				<div style="overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y: auto; height: 73%;">
					<p>
						<strong>Abstract:</strong> Instance-level video segmentation requires a solid integration of spatial and temporal information. However, current methods rely mostly on domain-specific information (online learning) to produce accurate instance-level segmentations. We propose a novel approach that relies exclusively on the integration of generic spatio-temporal attention cues. Our strategy, named Multi-Attention Instance Network (MAIN), overcomes challenging segmentation scenarios over arbitrary videos without modelling sequence- or instance-specific knowledge. We design MAIN to segment multiple instances in a single forward pass, and optimize it with a novel loss function that favors class agnostic predictions and assigns instance-specific penalties. We achieve state-of-the-art performance on the challenging Youtube-VOS dataset and benchmark, improving the unseen Jaccard and F-Metric by 6.8% and 12.7% respectively, while operating at real-time (30.3 FPS).

				<h3>Gabor Layers Enhance Network Robustness (ECCV 2020)</h3>

				<hr>

				<div style="overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y: auto; height: 73%;">
					<p>
						<strong>Abstract:</strong> We revisit the benefits of merging classical vision concepts with deep learning models. In particular, we explore the effect on robustness against adversarial attacks of replacing the first layers of various deep architectures with Gabor layers, i.e. convolutional layers with filters that are based on learnable Gabor parameters. We observe that architectures enhanced with Gabor layers gain a consistent boost in robustness over regular models and preserve high generalizing test performance, even though these layers come at a negligible increase in the number of parameters. We then exploit the closed form expression of Gabor filters to derive an expression for a Lipschitz constant of such filters, and harness this theoretical result to develop a regularizer we use during training to further enhance network robustness. We conduct extensive experiments with various architectures (LeNet, AlexNet, VGG16 and WideResNet) on several datasets (MNIST, SVHN, CIFAR10 and CIFAR100) and demonstrate large empirical robustness gains. Furthermore, we experimentally show how our regularizer provides consistent robustness improvements.

				<h3>Smart Pooling: AI-powered COVID-19 Testing (medRXiv)</h3>

				<hr>

				<div style="overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y: auto; height: 73%;">
					<p>
						<strong>Background:</strong> COVID-19 is an acute respiratory illness caused by the novel coronavirusSARS-CoV-2. The disease has rapidly spread to most countries and territories and hascaused 14.2 million confirmed infections and 602,037 deaths as of July 19th 2020. Massive molecular testing for COVID-19 has been pointed as fundamental to moderate the spread of the disease. Pooling methods can enhance the efficiency of testing, but they are viable only at very low incidences of the disease. We propose Smart Pooling, a machine learning method that uses clinical and sociodemographic data from patients to increase the efficiency of pooled molecular testing for COVID-19 by arranging samples into all-negative pools.
					</p>
					<p>
						<strong>Methods:</strong> We developed machine learning methods that estimate the probability that a sample will test positive for SARS-Cov-2 based on complementary information from the sample. We use these predictions to exclude samples predicted as positive from pools. We trained our machine learning methods on a dataset of 2000 patients tested for SARS-Cov-2 from April to July in Bogota, Colombia.
					</p>
					<p>
						<strong>Findings:</strong> Our method, Smart Pooling, shows efficiency of 306% at a disease prevalence of 5% and efficiency of 107% at disease a prevalence of up to 50%, a regime in which two-stage pooling offers marginal efficiency gains compared to individual testing. Additionally, we calculate the possible efficiency gains of one- and two-dimensional two-stage pooling strategies, and present the optimal strategies for disease prevalences up to 25%. We discuss practical limitations to conduct pooling in the laboratory.
					</p>
					<p>
						<strong>Interpretation:</strong> Pooled testing has been a theoretically alluring option to increase the coverage of diagnostics since its proposition by Dorfmann during World War II. Although there are examples of successfully using pooled testing to reduce the cost of diagnostics, its applicability has remained limited because efficiency drops rapidly as prevalence increases. Not only does our method provide a cost-effective solution to increase the coverage of testing amid the COVID-19 pandemic, but it also demonstrates that artificial intelligence can be used complementary with well-established techniques in the medical praxis.

				<h3>The Dynamics of Math Anxiety as it is Transferred through Peer and Teacher Interactions</h3>

				<hr>

				<div style="overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y: auto; height: 73%;">
					<p>
						<strong>Abstract:</strong> This research develops a simple dynamical system framework to study the role of social mechanisms on the prevalence of math anxiety in United States education systems. Math anxiety is the self reported discomfort when attempting mathematical problems. This feeling prevents students from pursuing careers in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics in these fields. Female students are disproportionately affected by math anxiety, leading to poor representation. Previous studies have examined how teachers, with and without math anxiety, can “transmit” math anxiety to students. However, to our knowledge no mathematical models have been developed to thoroughly study long term intervention strategies for reducing transmission. In this paper, the effects of female teachers’ math anxiety are modeled as a contagion on female students who may become the next generation of teachers. The purpose of this research is to determine intervention strategies to effectively reduce students’ math anxiety. From our sensitivity analysis we conclude that, instead of focusing on professional development, math anxiety can be drastically reduced if teachers portray more positive attitudes towards math, and colleges focus on recruiting non-anxious math teachers.
