						<p>I had two roles as a undergraduate assistant: The first one was to create questions covering the topics of each session. The other one was attempting office hours.</p>
						<li><strong>Accompaniment Program (January 2016 - December 2017)</strong></li>
						<p>This course was designed to help first semester students with introductory courses, such as Differential Calculus, Programming, Physics, Chemistry. Also, this course was designed to introduce these students into the university life.</p>
						<li><strong>Algorithmic and Programming Oriented by Objects I</strong></li>
						<p>This introductory course is mandatory for every engineer. It tackles basic concepts on programming based on objects on Java. I had two tasks as an assistance: initially, I had to grade every project and, secondly, I assisted the profesor on the laboratory sessions.</p>
