						<li><strong>PhD Researcher (August 2021 - August 2024), GREYC Laboratory, Universit√© de Caen, ENSICAEN</strong></li>
						<p>I focused my research in the field of explainable AI for computer vision. We managed to publish three articles (CVPR, ACCV, and WACV).</p>
						<li><strong>Graduate Research Assistant at Universidad de los Andes (January 2019 - July 2021)</strong></li>
						<p>My role comprises research duties in computer vision and machine learning. We published several articles in video object segmentation, adversarial robustness, and machine learning applied to COVID-19.</p>
						<li><strong>MTBI Summer Internship (Summer 2017):</strong></li>
						<p> The Mathematical and Theoretical Biology Institute (MTBI) Summer Program is an intership with a strong component on developping mathematical tools for modelling research. The first half of the internship is dedicated to learning those tools and the second one to apply them into research.</p>
						<p>For further information about my work please refer to the publication section (The Dynamics of Math Anxiety as it is Transferred through Peer and Teacher Interactions).</p>

						<li><strong>Tools for Computer Vision (October 2022 - December 2022 and October 2023 - December 2023):</strong></li>
						<p> The class targets fundamental tools for computer vision applications using pytorch. It begins by looking the main building block of the pytorch API, followed by showing different topics (e.g., classification, object detection, or generation). I was charge of 16 students (2h).</p>
						<li><strong>Processing and Image Analysis (July 2018 - December 2018):</strong></li>
						<p> The course tackles important features on Machine Learning topics. Concepts such as evaluation, dataset principles, Cluestering Algorithms, Support Vector Machines and Random Forest applied to natural images are studied.
						</p>
						<p>I had three roles within my teaching assistanship: The first of them is that I was charge of 80 students and four laboratory sections (1:20 horus each section). Secondly, I had to create and evaluate every laboratory assignment. Lastly, I was in charge of grading the final projects of this course.</p>
						<li><strong> Scientific Programming (January 2018 - June 2018):</strong></li>
						<p>The course tackles relevant tools to solve numerical problems such as optimization, numerical differentiation and integration, solving differential equations. </p>
						<p>I had three roles within my teaching assistanship: The first of them is that I was charge of 65 students and three laboratory sections (1:20 horus each section). Secondly, I had to create and evaluate every laboratory assignment. Lastly, I was in charge of grading the final projects of this course.</p>
						<li><strong>Processing and Image Analysis (July 2017 - December 2017):</strong></li>
						<p> The course tackles important features on Machine Learning topics. Concepts such as evaluation, dataset principles, Cluestering Algorithms, Support Vector Machines and Random Forest applied to natural images are studied.
						</p>
						<p>I had two roles as a undergraduate assistant: The first one was to create questions covering the topics of each session. The other one was attempting office hours.</p>
						<li><strong>Accompaniment Program (January 2016 - December 2017)</strong></li>
						<p>This course was designed to help first semester students with introductory courses, such as Differential Calculus, Programming, Physics, Chemistry. Also, this course was designed to introduce these students into the university life.</p>
						<li><strong>Algorithmic and Programming Oriented by Objects I</strong></li>
						<p>This introductory course is mandatory for every engineer. It tackles basic concepts on programming based on objects on Java. I had two tasks as an assistance: initially, I had to grade every project and, secondly, I assisted the profesor on the laboratory sessions.</p>
